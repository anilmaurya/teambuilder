Case study:

Assumptions:

You are an organization who gets a lot of candidates for their job requirements. 
Either you don't have an HR for your business or your HR team strenght is very less. 
You are open to trying new alternatives. 
You are open to using technology to try to solve your problems to scale your business. 
Every organization has a somewhat different recruitment process.
You receive the application/resumes via mail to a certain mail id eg: jobs@companyname.com


Sample size of applicant's 1000.

Suppose you've received 1000 applicant's resume for your job requirements that you published in various format's like pdf, rtf, doc etc.

Pain points:

It's a pain to manually read/scan through all those mails and shortlist candidates.
Every resume is in a different format.
We can't automatically filter candidates based on our criteria/parameters. eg: Filter/list all candidates above 70% in their graduation. 
It's a big pain to send mails manually to all the candidates informing them about shortlisting, further process and any other communication. 
Scheduling the interviews becomes a pain/nightmare, especially if multiple people/interviewers are involved.
Need to keep track of the notes/feedback about the candidate at each round by the interviewer, so that it can be reviewed later.
